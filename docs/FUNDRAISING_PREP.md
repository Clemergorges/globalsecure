## 2. Key Metrics (KPIs) to Memorize
Be ready to answer these instantly during calls:

*   **CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost):** What is the target cost to get a funded user? (e.g., $15-25).
*   **LTV (Lifetime Value):** How much revenue does a user generate over 2 years?
*   **Burn Rate:** How much cash are you spending monthly?
*   **Runway:** How many months until cash runs out? (Goal: 18-24 months with new funding).
*   **Take Rate:** What is your blended margin on volume? (e.g., 1.5%).

## 3. Investor FAQ (Pre-empting Objections)

**Q: How do you handle regulation?**
*   *Answer:* We use a hybrid model. Partnering with regulated entities (Stripe) for Fiat rails while operating as a non-custodial interface for Crypto initially, moving to full EMI/VASP licensing in Phase 3.

**Q: Why would users switch from Wise/Revolut?**
*   *Answer:* They don't support seamless Crypto-to-Spend flows. We are crypto-native but fiat-compatible. For our niche (freelancers paid in stablecoins), traditional banks are blockers, not competitors.

**Q: What is your "Moat"?**
*   *Answer:* Our integration depth (Vertical Integration). By owning the ledger logic between Polymer and Visa, we offer lower fees and higher speed than generic off-ramps.

## 4. The "Ask" Strategy
*   **Valuation:** Decide on SAFE vs. Equity Round.
*   **Lead Investor:** Focus on finding a lead who understands Fintech/Web3 intersection.
*   **Commitment:** "We are raising $X to reach [Milestone Y] in [Z Months]."
